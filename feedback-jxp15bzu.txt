Well commented.

Q1  20/20

I would not have approached the problem in quite the same way (notwithstanding the number of piles) 
although this is fine (much better than the initial approach)

Q2 15/20

All the elements are there but it is so much more complicated than necessary.

Q3 15/20

Fine but you make things more complicated than necessary. (see my solution).

Q4 20/20

Good.

Q5 23/20

Excellent. 3 Bonus points for this and general interest and effort in generalising to more than 2 piles. 
However, I cannot go to far on bonus points.

Overall mark 93%. Excellent!
